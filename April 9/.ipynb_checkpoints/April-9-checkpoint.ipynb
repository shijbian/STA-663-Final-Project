      "For this week's progress, I apologize that I did not do a lot, but I talked to professor about the basic structure of the final project I am going to write. The algorithm in the BHC paper is very general, it is an overall introduction to the BHC. From the perspective of coding background, it is very difficult for me to build up a very general BHC package from this paper. So I decide to do a specific example that use BHC to solve the problem. \n",

      "- does it work (i.e. does it produce correct results when given known data sets, possibly simulated)\n",
      "- is the code professional and readable?\n",
      "- has it been optimized?\n",
